# Virtual Tourist
 iOS application for Udacity Nanodegree iOS developer course

## Project Overview
The Virtual Tour application downloads and stores Flickr images. The app lets users pin bookmarks on a map, as if they were to stop on a tour. Then they will be able to download photos of the place and persist the photos and the association of the images with the marker.

## Installation
Open the `VirtualTourist.xcodeproj` in XCode and run it.
